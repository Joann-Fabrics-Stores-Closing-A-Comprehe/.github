## The Announcement: What We Know So Far  

On October 15th, Joann Inc., the parent company of Joann Fabrics, released an official statement confirming plans to close approximately 80 locations by mid-2025. While the exact **list of Joann stores closing** is yet to be fully disclosed, preliminary reports suggest that several states—including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and California—will see significant reductions in their retail footprint. Notably, many of the affected outlets are situated in smaller towns or suburban areas where foot traffic has dwindled over the past decade.  

This decision comes amid mounting pressure from online competitors like Amazon and Etsy, as well as changing shopping habits among consumers who increasingly prefer e-commerce platforms over brick-and-mortar stores. Furthermore, rising operational costs and supply chain disruptions have exacerbated Joann's financial struggles, making it difficult for the retailer to sustain its current number of physical locations.

## Why Are Joann Stores Closing?  

To understand the root causes behind Joann Fabrics’ decision to shutter dozens of stores, we must first examine broader economic and industry-specific factors at play. First and foremost, the rise of digital marketplaces has revolutionized the way people shop for crafting supplies. Websites offering everything from discounted fabric rolls to custom embroidery kits have made it easier—and often cheaper—for customers to fulfill their needs without leaving home.  

Additionally, inflationary pressures have hit small businesses particularly hard. Rising prices for raw materials such as cotton, polyester, and yarn have squeezed profit margins for Joann and similar retailers. Coupled with increased labor costs due to minimum wage hikes in various states, maintaining profitability has become increasingly challenging.  

Moreover, demographic shifts cannot be ignored. Many of Joann’s core customers belong to older generations who traditionally shopped in person. Younger demographics, however, tend to favor convenience and immediacy, traits better served by online retailers. Consequently, Joann has struggled to attract younger shoppers despite efforts to modernize its brand through social media campaigns and loyalty programs.

## Which JoAnn Stores Are Closing?  

While the complete list of **Joann stores closing** remains under wraps, leaked documents obtained by *WNEP Closings* provide some insight into the regions most affected. According to these reports, multiple outlets in Pennsylvania, including those in Scranton and Allentown, are slated for closure. Similarly, WCAV closings indicate that Vermont-based branches may also face shutdowns.  

For those eager to verify whether their local Joann Fabric store is on the chopping block, the company has promised to release an updated "Joann stores closing list" by December 2024. Until then, concerned patrons can contact customer service or visit the official Joann website for real-time updates.  

It’s worth noting that not all locations will be impacted equally. Urban centers with higher population densities, such as New York City and Los Angeles, appear less likely to lose their Joann stores compared to rural or semi-rural areas. This strategic move underscores Joann’s intent to focus resources on markets with greater revenue potential.

## Impact on Local Communities  

The impending wave of **Joann Fabrics stores closing** carries profound implications for local economies and creative communities. For decades, Joann stores have served as hubs for crafting workshops, sewing classes, and other educational initiatives aimed at fostering creativity and skill-building. With fewer physical locations available, access to these resources could diminish significantly, especially in underserved areas.  

Small business owners reliant on Joann for wholesale purchases may also feel the pinch. Independent designers, quilters, and tailors often depend on the retailer’s wide selection of fabrics and notions to meet client demands. Losing nearby Joann stores could force them to seek alternatives, potentially driving up expenses and complicating logistics.

## Looking Ahead: Will Joann Survive?  

Despite the gloomy outlook, Joann executives remain optimistic about the future. In interviews following the announcement, CEO Wade Miquelon emphasized the importance of adapting to evolving market conditions. He outlined ambitious plans to bolster the company’s e-commerce platform while exploring partnerships with third-party vendors to expand product offerings.  

Furthermore, Joann intends to retain key flagship locations as experiential showrooms where customers can engage with products before purchasing online. By blending digital innovation with tactile experiences, the company hopes to strike a balance between tradition and modernity.  

Whether these measures will prove sufficient to reverse Joann’s fortunes remains uncertain. Analysts caution that success hinges on execution; any missteps could spell further trouble for the beleaguered retailer.
